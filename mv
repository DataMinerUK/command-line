mv takes moves OR renames a file depending on the type of the last argument given.
In the first instance, if the last argument is a directory it will move all previous arguments into that directory.
In the last instance, mv can take two files or directories and renames the first argument to the last argument.

Switch options include:

-f to force overwrite without asking permission
-i to interact by asking permission before each overwrite
-n to not overwrite an existing file
-v to be verbose, showing files after they are moved
