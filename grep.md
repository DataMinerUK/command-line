GREP

The `grep` command searches the contents of files or standard input. Regular expressions can be used. Each input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written to the standard output.

* `-c` to give a count of the matched lines
* `-i` to ignore case sensitivity
* `-n` to give the line count witht the resulting output
* `-r` to search recursively
